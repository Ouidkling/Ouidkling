### Hello, I am @matteo-nc, a french student living in Limoges.
I am in my third year of BUT Informatique (3 year degree).  
Currently a developer at Assortir by LISI, leading projects around Sage 100.  
Learning multiple languages and paradigms, but slightly better with the .NET ecosystem.  
Enjoying it before all.
