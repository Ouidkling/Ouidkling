### Hello, I am @matteo-nc, a french student living in Limoges.
I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and going for a masters's degree in cyber security.  
I was a developer at Assortir by LISI, leading projects around Sage 100.  
I learn multiple languages and paradigms, but I am slightly better with the .NET ecosystem.  
  
Enjoying it before everything else.
